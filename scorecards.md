Scorecard Generator
===================

## Overview

Need scorecards for your competition? Email [scorecards@matthewmcmillan.me](mailto:scorecards@matthewmcmillan.me) with your competition workbook and [this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1cXHxu9p9o6TnQxbVZod2p0Znc) filled out with your competition information. If you have questions, feel free to email them to that email as well. You should receive generated scorecards within 24 hours. Please note that the cards are in order - simple cut the entire pile of sheets in half both directions, and each stack will already be sorted by event and alphabetically by competitor in each event.

## Features:


* All WCA events are supported
* Each card has the competitor's name, WCA ID, and CubeComps ID (for easy data entry)
* Hard and soft cutoffs are optionally printed on each card (with soft cutoffs printed in the appropriate place depending on the number of attempts)
* Big fields for writing the time and signature (like old CubingUSA scorecards)
* Events with only 3 attempts have the unused fields completely blanked for clarity
* Cards are ordered by event, and alphabetically by first name within each event
* Cards are ordered so that when they are printed and the stack is cut into 4 quarters, each stack is in order (no need to manually sort)
* Am I missing something? Email [scorecards@matthewmcmillan.me](mailto:scorecards@matthewmcmillan.me) with suggestions!

## Why?

After the CubingUSA scorecard generator was taken down, I had to look into the only alternative, CubeComps. While these scorecards do have some benefits, they are also a pain to generate (you have to open new rounds) and have several other minor annoyances (the judge signature is after the competitor signature even though the card will be in the judge's hand from writing down the time, there wasn't as much space to write the times, etc). Instead of using those, I decided to write my own generator, which combined the features that were most helpful from both the CubingUSA cards and the CubeComps cards (CubingUSA ID's, big fields, cutoffs printed on the card, etc). I've refined the cards after using them at Lexington Summer 2016 and Melrose Summer 2016, and it seems that there haven't been any issues with them.
