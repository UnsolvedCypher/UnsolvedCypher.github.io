    <p>This is a modified game of tetris (forked from <a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris">here</a>) that also tracks fragmentation in the Tetris board. Fragmentation in computer memory is when memory is wasted either because too much was allocated to a process and the process didn't use it all, or because the free space in memory is not contiguous, and the amount of contiguous memory is too small to make use of. This game simulates this issue with tetris blocks, where the gaps between the blocks represent memory that cannot be used because the gap is too small. In real systems, paging is usually used, so that the amount of memory allocated is fixed, which solves the problem of pieces of small memory being unusable.</p>
    <p>In this game, fragmentation is counted as the amount of empty blocks inaccessible from the top or sides divided by the total amount of full blocks and fragments (including filled blocks in rows that have been completely filled and have disappeared). You can see that the fragmentation increases each time you block a space from the top and sides, but it goes down if you're able to remove the blockage from the top (the equivalent of the operating system freeing adjacent memory resulting in a bigger block). Similarly, as you have more rows completely filled out, your fragmentation as a percent goes down because there are no gaps in these completed rows.</p>
    <p>To start a game, press space. Left and right arrow keys move the piece to the left and right, the down arrow moves it downwards, and the up arrow rotates the piece. Professors teaching Operating Systems are strongly encouraged to use this activity in place of an assessment.</p>
